# Welcome to Installer Repo

I made this for easy installation of apps and drivers.

**NOTE**- Only for Ubuntu & <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/ubuntu-based-linux-distributions/#:~:text=10%20Best%20Ubuntu-based%20Linux%20Distributions%201%20Linux%20Mint.,...%209%20Ubuntu%20Budgie.%20...%20More%20items...%20">Ubuntu based distributions</a> *but* some of the scripts may work on other distros.

Currently It supports-
1. `rtl8188gu driver` (Realtek Corporation Non Offical Drivers) Source repo for driver is <a href="https://github.com/mcmccru/rtl8188gu">here</a>
2. `Discord` (Discord app from official website)
3. `Visual Studio Code` (Named as code.sh [Official])
